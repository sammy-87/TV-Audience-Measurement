## Meeting Minutes - 14th December, 2018

1. What is the computational complexity and Ram and hardware usage ?
2. Donâ€™t need to exactly quantify and but sort of should give an example of R-Pi.

3. Logo change for a special occasion
4. Address multiple solutions and how we narrow down to the best solution ?

5. GSM for sending and receiving new logos or changed logos on special occasions
6. We are able to detect noise and able to give warnings.
7. Sending of warning for malicious acts is not possible in audio based solution

8. Their implementation is easier at hardware end but broadcaster dependent but our implementation is more complex but not dependent on broadcaster

9. R-Pi pe shayad nahi chalega ad recognition but future technology pe achhe hardware and cheap honge toh we can give this argument

10. To the best of our knowledge give speculation that this should work according to our knowledge

11. Use PCA as a feature in audio for ad detection

12. Datasets jo humne banaya hai wo saare type ke ads ko consider karke kiya hai

13. Krishna Jagannathan IIT Madras- how to make a technical presentation

14. Minimize human labour and dependencies on 3rd party

15. Central node concept then at each user node computation will be very less. Just send the channel and timestamp.

16. Inscape
