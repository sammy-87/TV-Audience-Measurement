### Meeting Minutes - 7th December, 2018
#### Age and gender Detection
1. Cannot use webcam 
2. Cannot use only thermal camera since accuracy wonâ€™t be good.
3. Use the prestored data taken by BARC of the number of people in a household to fine tune the age and gender. 

#### Hardware 
1. Video converter to convert analog to digital
2. Capture card is a converter for the above problem
3. Hardware (capture card ) has been ordered

#### Hardware size optimization
1. Raspberry Pi or Atmega
2. Prototype can be done on R-Pi and we can suggest other small chips or embedded hardware to them for practical implementation
3. GPU (cost around 3000) and much smaller than R-Pi can be used and it will also fasten the computation
4. What are the different possible options which we can present for implementation in the entire country ?

#### Channel Identification
1. Logo Recognition
2. Take patches at the four corners

#### Content Identification
1. Need the video and label. Friends for example ka video and label hona chahiye ek database me
2-streamed network, activity recognition,  (ask Sankhe) and use SVM to classify the label for content
2. Find Dataset and how scalable it would be
3. Use channel information to reduce the classification task to say 50 serials (upper bound) on say Star Plus or Zee TV

#### Ad identification
1. Metadata
2. Find all attributes and then form metadata for a particular day.
3. **How to distinguish between advertisements and actual content ?**

#### How to remove the entire hardware ?
1. Use LAN available in cities and data can be directly sent to cloud for computation to reduce the hardware at the user end.
